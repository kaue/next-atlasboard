[![Build Status](https://drone.io/bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlasboard/status.png)](https://drone.io/bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlasboard/latest)

Atlasboard is a dashboard framework written in nodejs. Check out the [website](http://atlasboard.bitbucket.org).

# Installation

```
npm install -g atlasboard
```

# Creating your first wallboard

```
atlasboard new mywallboard
```

# Running your wallboard

## Using the global atlasboard module:

```
atlasboard start
```

With a predefined port:

```
atlasboard start 3000
```

### Command line filters

To run one particular job only:

```
atlasboard start --job myjob
```

you can use regular expressions:

```
atlasboard start --job "my(.*)b"
```

Or one particular dashboard:

```
atlasboard start --dashboard mydashboard
```

or use regular expressions:

```
atlasboard start --dashboard my(.*)board
```

This is specially useful during development so you only bring up the components you need.

## Running your wallboard using Atlasboard as a module

You can start your wallboard without needing Atlasboard to be installed globally.
From your wallboard directory, assuming that you have ``start.js`` run:

```
npm start
```

``start.js`` looks like this and it is included in > 1.0:

```
var atlasboard = require('atlasboard');
atlasboard({port: process.env.ATLASBOARD_PORT || 3000, install: true}, function (err) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }
});
```

You'll need to add the atlasboard dependency to your ``package.json``.

# Importing your first package

You will probably want to reuse other people's dashboards, widgets and jobs. To do so, you'll need to import a "package", which is just a [git submodule](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule).

The [Atlassian package](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlasboard-atlassian-package) is a good place to start. If you haven't already, initialise a git repository for your new wallboard, and then type:

    git init
    git submodule add https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlasboard-atlassian-package packages/atlassian

# Documentation

## Migrating from Atlasboard 0.x

Nothing is supposed to break once you upgrade but you may want to update a few things:

- Make sure you are running nodejs >= 0.10
- Make sure your configuration is properly moved to the new [file structure](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlasboard/raw/master/config) and delete the old configuration files.
Adjust verbosity in logging as you see it fit.
- Writing jobs: Old jobs are still compatible but you probably want to start writing new ones using the new ``onInit`` and ``onRun`` handlers (read below for more details).
- Updating dashboards: Feel free to update your dashboards to use the new ``title``, ``titleVisible`` and ``description`` properties so they look good in the dashboard list page.

## Architecture

![Architecture](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlasboard/raw/master/screenshots/atlasboard-architecture.png?at=master)

## Components

#### Dashboards

To create your first dashboard, type the following command:

```
atlasboard generate dashboard mydashboard
```

This will generate a default dashboard using [this template](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlasboard/raw/master/templates/new-components/dashboard?at=master).


##### Dashboard descriptor structure:

* `enabled` enables/displays the dashboard. This is a quick way to hide your dashboard without having to delete it. Defaults to ``true``.

* `title` dashboard title (optional). Most of the time you will not need this.

* `titleVisible` if true, the title will appear in the wallboard. Otherwise, it will be used only in the dashboard list page.

* `description` dashboard description (optional). To be displayed in the dashboard list page.

* `layout`

    * `gridSize` grid size is customizable. Example: `"gridSize" : { "columns" : 8, "rows" : 6 } `

    * `customJs` the names of any extra JavaScript libraries, located in `assets/javascripts`, that you'd like included. *(warning: this could be moved out of the layout key in future releases)*.

    * `widgets` an array of objects detailing each widget to be displayed on the dashboard. Each `widgets` object has the following attributes:

        * `enabled` enables/disables this particular widget/job. Defaults to ``true``.

        * `row` value from 1 to maxRows. You can also use `r`.

        * `col` value from 1 to maxColumns. You can also use `c`.

        * `width` number of columns this widget will occupy. You can also use `w`.

        * `height` number of rows this widget will occupy. You can also use `h`.

        * `widget` widget name. If you want to refer to a widget inside an specific package, use the namespace `<package>#<widgetname>` syntax (e.g. ``atlasboard#quotes``).

        * `job` Job to be executed. The same namespace syntax applies to specifying jobs.

        * `config` The config key or array of keys that will be used for this dashboard item.

* `config` a config object for this dashboard, containing a key-value container for job configuration.


##### Example dashboard config file

```
{
  "enabled": true,

  "title": "aurora",
  "description": "aurora's wallboard",

  "layout": {
    "gridSize" : { "columns" : 6, "rows" : 4 },
    "customJS" : [],
    "widgets" : [
      {
        "row" : 1, "col" : 1,
        "width" : 2, "height" : 3,
        "widget" : "quotes", "job" : "quotes-famous", "config" : "quotes"
      }
    ]
  },

  "config" : {
    "quotes" : {
      "numberQuotes" : 10
    }
  }
}
```

##### Using the common dashboard config file

If you want to share the same configuration for more than one dashboard, place it inside `/config/dashboard_common.json` so that you donÂ´t have to repeat it. Atlasboard will merge the configuration keys found in this file with the current dashboard configuration.

##### Using multiple configurations

If you want to use multiple configurations for your job, set the `config` value to an array of keys. Each key can exist in either the current configuration, the shared configuration, or both.

For each configuration key in the array, the local value will override the global, and key `n+1` will override key `n`.

###### Multiple Configurations Example

One use case for multiple configurations is an api root URL used by multiple jobs.

In the shared configuration below, the `system-api` key contains a `url` pointing to the api location. It also includes a default `path` value.

_config/dashboard_common.json_
```
"config:" {
  "system-api": {
    "url": "http://localhost/api/v1",
    "path": "/"
  }
}
```

There are two jobs referenced by the dashboard, `system-users` and `system-products`. Both jobs use the same api, but for different data resources, and at different update intervals.

_my_dashboard.json_
```
{
  "widget" : "users",
  "job" : "system-users",
  "config": [ "system-api", "system-users"]
},
{
  "widget" : "products",
  "job" : "system-products",
  "config": [ "system-api", "system-products"]
}

...

"config": {

  "system-users": {
    "path": "/people",
    "interval":60000
  },

  "system-products": {
    "path": "/products",
    "interval":10000
  },
}
```

Each job references the shared key (_`system-api`_) as the first item in its `config` array. It adds the local, overriding configuration key (_`system-users`_ and _`system-products`_) as the next entry. The job's `onInit` method can then use these values to construct the correct URL for api calls.

Resulting `config` for _system-users_ job:
```
{
  "url": "http://localhost/api/v1",
  "path": "/users",
  "interval": 60000
}
```

Resulting `config` for _system-products_ job:
```
{
  "url": "http://localhost/api/v1",
  "path": "/products",
  "interval": 10000
}
```

#### Jobs

Jobs are run in the background (server side) by the scheduler. Their purpose is to send data to the client-side widgets. You can generate one in the default package by typing:

```
atlasboard generate job myjob
```

This will generate a job using [this template](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlasboard/raw/master/templates/new-components/job?at=master).

A very simple job could look like this:

```
module.exports = function(config, dependencies, jobCallback) {
    var text = "Hello World!";
    // first parameter is error (if any). Second parameter is the job result (if success)
    // you can use the following dependencies:
    // - dependencies.request : request module (https://github.com/mikeal/request)
    // - dependencies.logger : logger interface

   jobCallback(null, {title: config.widgetTitle, text: text});
};
```

If you want to do something more interesting, like scraping data for example:

```
var $ = require('cheerio');

module.exports = function(config, dependencies, job_callback) {
	var logger = dependencies.logger;
	dependencies.easyRequest.HTML('http://myprivatewebsite.com', function(err, html) {
		var result = [];
		if (err) {
			logger.error('there was an error running my job, let\'s log it!');
			// send error message to the widget so it can handle it
			job_callback(err);
		} else {
			var $page = $(html);
			$page.find('table tr').each(function(index, element) {
				result.push($(element).find('td:nth-child(1)'));
			});
			// this is being sent to the widget through the socket channel
			job_callback(null, { data: result });
		}
	});
};
```

Since 1.0, you can export a job object containing an ``onInit`` and ``onRun`` functions:

```
module.exports = {

  /**
   * Executed on job initialisation (only once)
   * @param config
   * @param dependencies
   */
  onInit: function (config, dependencies) {

  },

  /**
   * Executed every interval
   * @param config
   * @param dependencies
   * @param jobCallback
   */
  onRun: function (config, dependencies, jobCallback) {

  }
}
```

This is handy when you want to run some initialisation code only once in your job. This is also the preferred way and the old way may not be supported in future releases.

#### Job dependencies

As you may have noticed, Atlasboards exposes a few handy dependencies. Check [their source](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlasboard/raw/master/lib/job-dependencies/?at=master).

#### Widgets

Widgets run in the client-side (web browser). To create one:

```
atlasboard generate widget mywidget
```

This will generate a widget using [this template](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlasboard/raw/master/templates/new-components/widget?at=master). These are the files created for you in your default package:

##### mywidget.html

```
<h2>mywidget</h2>
<div class="content">
  <p>This is how you link a "cold.png" image that is located on the 'hot-overview' widget inside the
    "default" package</p>
  <img src="/widgets/resources?resource=default/hot-overview/cold.png" alt="my image"/>
</div>
```

Since 1.0, you can create widgets in stylus and pick up variables exported by your current theme:

##### mywidget.styl

```
.content
    font-size 2em
    color $gray-lighter

    .error
      color $error-color
```

##### mywidget.js

```
widget = {
  //runs when we receive data from the job
  onData: function(el, data) {
    //The parameters our job passed through are in the data object
    //el is our widget element, so our actions should all be relative to that
    if (data.title) {
      $('h2', el).text(data.title);
    }

    $('.content', el).html(data.text);
  }
};
```

##### Widget event handlers

You can use the following handlers in your widget:

```
/**
 * Called when the widget gets initialised. Before the arrival of first data
 * @param {JQuery} $widgetContainer widget container object
 * @param {string} widgetId
 */

onInit: function($widgetContainer, widgetId){}

/**
 * Called when the widget receives data from the server
 * @param {JQuery} $widgetContainer widget container object
 * @param {Object} data data parameter
 * @param {string} widgetId
 */

onData: function($widgetContainer, data, widgetId){}

/**
 * Called when the widget receives an error response from the server
 * @param {JQuery} $errorContainer error container object
 * @param {Object} data data parameter
 * @param {Object} data.error error object
 * @param {string} widgetId
 */

onError: function($errorContainer, data, widgetId){}
```

Most of the times you only want to work with ``onData`` though.

## Client side plugins

You can add client side plugins to extend Atlasboard's default behaviour. Just register global
event handlers that will be called for each widget according to its life-cycle.

The client side events you can subscribe to are:

```
// widget events:

/**
 * Called when the widget gets initialised. Before the arrival of first data
 * @param e event
 * @param {JQuery} data.$widgetContainer widget container object
 * @param {string} data.widgetId
 */

atlasboard.on("widgetInit", function (e, data) {}

/**
 * Called when the widget receives an error response from the server
 * @param e event
 * @param {JQuery} data.$errorContainer error container object
 * @param {Object} data.data.error error object
 * @param {string} data.widgetId
 */

atlasboard.on("widgetError", function (e, data) {}

/**
 * Called when the widget receives data from the server
 * @param e event
 * @param {JQuery} data.$widgetContainer widget container object
 * @param {Object} data.data data object
 * @param {string} data.widgetId
 */

altasboard.on("widgetData", function (e, data) {}

// socket.io events:

atlasboard.on("socketConnected", function (e) {}
atlasboard.on("socketDisconnected", function (e) {}
atlasboard.on("socketReconnectFailed", function (e) {}
atlasboard.on("socketReconnecting", function (e) {}
```

For example, the client side plugin that manages the spinner is just this:

```
(function () {

  atlasboard.on("widgetInit", function (e, data) {

    var spinner = new Spinner({
      className: 'spinner',
      color: '#f5f5f5',
      width: 5,
      length: 15,
      radius: 25,
      lines: 12,
      speed: 0.7,
      shadow: true
    }).spin();

    $("<div>").addClass("spinner").append(spinner.el).appendTo(data.$widgetContainer.parent());
  });

  atlasboard.on("widgetPreData", function (e, data) {
    $('.spinner', data.$widgetContainer.parent()).hide();
  });

  atlasboard.on("widgetPreError", function (e, data) {
    $('.spinner', data.$errorContainer.parent()).hide();
  });

})();
```

Or, let's see you want to build a silly plugin that makes the content of the 'goal-metrics' widget yellow:

```
// custom-color.js
(function(){

  atlasboard.on("widgetInit", function(e, data){
    if (data.widgetId === 'goal-metrics') {
      data.$widgetContainer.css({css: 'yellow'});
    }
  });

})();
```

Remember that you add custom JS to your wallboard using the ``customJS`` field in the dashboard.json file:

```
    "layout": {
        "gridSize" : { "columns" : 20, "rows" : 12 },
        "customJS": ["custom-color.js", "jquery.peity.js", "md5.js"],
        "widgets": [ ... ]

```

## Credentials

[Check the wiki for more info about the globalAuth.json file](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlasboard/wiki/Atlasboard%20Authentication)

You can also use environment variables in your globalAuth.json:

```
{
  "hipchat": {
    "token": "${HIPCHAT_TOKEN}"
  },
  "stash": {
    "username": "${STASH_USER}",
    "password": "${STASH_PASS}"
  },
  "bitbucket.org": {
    "username": "${BITBUCKET_USER}",
    "password": "${BITBUCKET_PASS}"
  },
  "graphite": {
    "username": "${GRAPHITE_USER}",
    "password": "${GRAPHITE_PASS}"
  }
}
```

in your ``.bashrc``:

```
export HIPCHAT_TOKEN='yourtoken'
```

you can define where the authentication file lives by setting the appropriate path here:

```
//config/auth.js

{ "authenticationFilePath": "globalAuth.json" }
```

## Configuration

Both default Atlasboard configuration and the local configuration for your wallboard is stored in the ``config`` folder.

Your wallboard will extend Atlasboard's.

```
<yourwallboardlocation>/config/logging.js
<yourwallboardlocation>/config/auth.js
<yourwallboardlocation>/config/theming.js
```

Also, you can extend the final configuration with your ``ENV``:

``ATLASBOARD_CONFIG_<config-file-name>`` expects JSON format:

```
export ATLASBOARD_CONFIG_theming='{"theme":"foundation"}'
```

## Logging

Atlasboard uses [tracer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tracer)
Since 1.0 you can override the default logging configuration:

```
<yourwallboardlocation>/config/logging.js
```

### Logging from your job:

```
module.exports = function(config, dependencies, job_callback) {
  var text = "Hello World!";

  var logger = dependencies.logger;
  logger.log('I am a log message');
  logger.trace('text is ' + text);
  logger.debug('text is ' + text);
  logger.info('I am an info message');
  logger.warn('I am a warning message');
  logger.error('this is an error!')

  job_callback(null, {title: config.widgetTitle, text: text});
};
```

### Log visualizer

If you enable real-time logging in ``yourwallboard/config/logging.js``, you will be able to access logs through a socket.io connection:

```
{
  "liveLoggingWebAccess" : true
}
```

![Log viewer](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlasboard/raw/master/screenshots/atlasboard-log-viewer.png)

## Custom templates

You can use your custom ``dashboard.ejs`` or ``dashboard-list.ejs`` template just creating a file with that name in:

```
yourwallboard/templates/dashboard.ejs
yourwallboard/templates/dashboard-list.ejs
```

## Theming support

Since 1.0 you can use themes. For example:

``yourwallboard/themes/inferno/variables.styl``

The inferno theme overrides the following stylus variables:

```
$background-color = red
$widget-background-color = red;
$widget-border = 0
$widget-box-shadow = none
```

You can define as many themes as you want:

```
yourwallboard/themes/default/variables.styl
yourwallboard/themes/inferno/variables.styl
yourwallboard/themes/adg/variables.styl
yourwallboard/themes/lego/variables.styl
```

and set your current one in the ``theming.js`` configuration file:

```
// yourwallboard/config/theming.js

module.exports = {
  theme: 'inferno'
};

```

[These](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlasboard/raw/master/assets/stylesheets/variables.styl?at=master) are the variables you can override with your custom theme.



## Adding express routes in your job

Since 1.0, jobs have access to the express app, so you can easily add routes to the app. Example:

```
/**
 * Job: my job
 */

module.exports = {

  onInit: function (config, dependencies) {
    dependencies.logger.info('adding routes...');
    dependencies.app.route("/jobs/mycustomroute")
        .get(function (req, res) {
          res.end('So something useful here');
        });

  },

  onRun: function (config, dependencies, jobCallback) {
    // code to be executed every interval
  }
};
```
